# Fizl (Beta)

Fizl is a simple way to create a site that doesn't need a CMS and has a relatively simple structure. It doesn't have a database - you simply create the site structure in the filesystem and use Fizl tools and plugins to embed and template your site.

Check out Fizl info and a demo here:
