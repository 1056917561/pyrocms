<h2>Designer's Guide</h2>

<p>
	PyroCMS supports themes which allow you to easily change the look and feel of your website.
	The way it works is with a master <a href="designers/layouts.html">layout</a> file and 
	multiple <a href="designers/partials.html">partials</a> that share presentation logic between different layouts.
</p>

<p>
	To create your first theme it is a good idea to look at the default theme and see how it works. You might even like
	to copy it and tweak it to create your own. The default theme is located in <dfn>system/pyrocms/themes/default</dfn>. Copy that to
	<dfn>addons/themes/custom</dfn> or whatever name you like. Open <dfn>addons/themes/custom/theme.php</dfn> and change the name of the PHP class
	to Theme_Custom and put your own details in there.
